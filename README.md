ðŸ§  What This Is
BudgetPro is a lightweight personal finance dashboard designed to help users visualize their income, track expenses, monitor debt, and stay on top of upcoming bills. It provides a clean and structured interface to make budgeting more intuitive and actionable.

The app includes:

ðŸ’¡ Why I Built It
This project was built to demonstrate how financial data can be organized and presented in a way that is clear, actionable, and user-friendly. It also reflects my ability to quickly design and implement feature-rich interfaces that simulate real-world use cases. Iâ€™m currently looking for software engineering roles and built this to show what I can deliver in a focused timeframe.
